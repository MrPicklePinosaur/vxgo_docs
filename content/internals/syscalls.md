# System Calls

how are syscalls implemented by the go compiler?

go does not use libc, instead it calls syscalls directly using autogenerated library specified by the platform ABI. Relevant source code is found in `/syscall`.

## linux

Since linux system calls have fixed system call codes, system calls can be made directly via the `syscall` instruction.

## solaris

Solaris makes use of a wrapper libc that makes the syscalls. For this reason, cgo is needed
